<center><a href="http://19-1-skku-oss.github.io/2019-1-OSS-E5/"><b>2019-1-OSS-E5</b></a> Our work is related with making helpful python algorithm for educator. If you have any question, please send email to jaewan7599@skku.edu.</center>

## About Original Project
All Algorithms implemented in python


These implementations are for demonstration and educational purposes. Almost parts of project are consisted with Data structures, sorting algorithms, search algorithms, etc. They are less efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library.

## Our Project & Activity
Improve original project by :
1. Make new algorithm files.
2. Korean explanation for py file.
3. Organize folders.
4. Add function for py file.
5. Add comments in py file to help understand code better.
6. Korean README file in each algorithm file.

## How to Contribute

**Korean Translation**<br>
- lots of files are only written in English. <br>
So anybody can contribute by translating py code English to korean. <br>
We need a lot of help in this area.

**Adding Code** <br>
We need addtional code and variaty of algorithms :
- Add algorithm
- Add function
- Delete unneeded file

**Explaning algorithms** <br>
There are too little explanations for beginners. So you can contribute by :
- Explanation in py code
- Explanation in README file.
